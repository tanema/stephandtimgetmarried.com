                  Steph and Tim met in the first year of their undergraduate degrees, most likely freezing their toes off in Northern Ontario. Steph studied social work and Tim studied computer science.  They were best friends for most of undergrad but it wasn't until 5th year that they realized that they really, really liked each other, and that they should probably be more than just friends. After graduating, they decided to pick up and travel across the planet together, spending a year in Australia, petting koala bears and riding kangaroos.  When they came home, Steph went off to get her Masters and Tim started working as a Software Developer. They moved to Toronto shortly thereafter and began deciding who would get more space in the closet (Steph did). Now, Steph and Tim live happily in the city known, among other things, for a really bad mayor, a hopelessly losing hockey team and of course, everyone's hero, Drake (the #6ix).  Steph is working on her doctoral dissertation and Tim is continuing his career as the CTO of a tech startup. Ups and downs, lefts and rights, good and bad, they have come out victorious as an awesome couple who are ready to share a great day with you.

                <h3>WHEN IS THE WEDDING, AGAIN?</h3>
                <p>
                  We're getting married on July 16, 2016 at 5:30pm at Archeo, which is located in the historic Distillery District of Toronto. Don't miss it!
                </p>

                <h3>WHERE CAN I STAY?</h3>
                <p>
                We've booked two hotel blocks that you can check out in the <a href="#where_to_stay">Where to Stay</a> section.  Toronto is a big city, and as such, there are plenty of other hotels, but fair warning - we anticipate the city being busier than usual because of an international Microsoft conference taking place on our wedding weekend. We recommend booking long before January.  You can also try <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">airbnb.com</a> for a variety of accommodation options.

                <h3>HOW CAN I GET TO THE VENUE?</h3>
                <p>
                  There are lots of ways to get around the city! Please take advantage of the awesome public transit in Toronto and our faithful cab services. We want everyone to have an awesome and safe time, so if possible, consider leaving your car at the hotel or at home. From both hotels, a cab ride to the venue should be around $10, depending on traffic. For a cab, call Co-Op Taxi: 416-504-2667. Oh, and if you do drive, watch out for cyclists!

                <h3>WHAT ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSIT?</h3>
                <p>
                  To get to Archeo, take the 504 King Streetcar to the Trinity Street stop (just east of Parliament), then walk south on Trinity for about 5 minutes and you'll be there! A cab from Union Station to the venue is around $10 to $15 dollars.

                <h3>WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?</h3>
                <p>
                  The dress code for our wedding is strictly "wear whatever makes you feel awesome" attire. Also, the Distillery District has beautiful cobblestone roads/footpaths, so keep that in mind when choosing shoes.

                <h3>WHAT WILL THE WEATHER BE LIKE IN TORONTO IN JULY?</h3>
                <p>
                  July in Toronto tends to be sunny and warm (on average 25°C.) The ceremony will be outdoors and will start at 5:30pm, so it should be pretty comfortable!

                  Expect good music, good food, good drinks and good company! Both our ceremony and our reception will be taking place at Archeo so you don't have to worry about travelling/getting lost/killing time in between. Our ceremony will start promptly at 5:30pm and will be outdoors. We'll have cocktails and a delicious dinner immediately afterwards, followed by dancing and merriment! There will be plenty to eat and drink! The bar will be open all night (yay!) but last call will be around 1:00am. I know you were wondering.
